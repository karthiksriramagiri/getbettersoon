                            <h2>Hello, I'm Sriprada Rayavarapu</h2>
                            <p class="intro-tagline">Premed Student | Aspiring Cardiologist | Health Education Advocate</p>
                            
                            <p>As a premed student with dreams of attending medical school, I've always been passionate about making healthcare knowledge accessible to everyone - especially families with young children.</p>
                            
                            <p>GetBetterSoon was born from my own experiences seeing how scared and confused children can feel when facing medical situations or health challenges. I believe that when families understand what's happening, everyone feels more confident and less afraid.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through my premed studies and research, I've learned that education is one of the most powerful tools in healthcare. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex medical information and family-friendly understanding.</p>
