                    <h3>What is a Broken Bone?</h3>
                    <p>A broken bone (also called a fracture) happens when too much force is put on a bone and it cracks or breaks apart. Think of it like a stick that bends too far and snaps. Your bones are much stronger than sticks, but sometimes accidents happen!</p>
